                    its speed, tried to clear the way with its cowâ€“catcher; but the mass of animals was too great. The buffaloes marched along with a tranquil gait, uttering now and then deafening bellowings. There was no use of interrupting them, for,
                    having taken a particular direction, nothing can moderate and change their course; it is a torrent of living flesh which no dam could contain.

                    The travellers gazed on this curious spectacle from the platforms; but Phileas Fogg, who had the most reason of all to be in a hurry, remained in his seat, and waited philosophically until it should please the buffaloes to get out of the way. Passepartout
                    was furious at the delay they occasioned, and longed to discharge his arsenal of revolvers upon them.

                    "What a country!" cried he. "Mere cattle stop the trains, and go by in a procession, just as if they were not impeding travel! Parbleu! I should like to know if Mr. Fogg foresaw this mishap in his programme! And here's an engineer who doesn't dare to
                    run the locomotive into this herd of beasts!"
